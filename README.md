# Vote Plan data

This repository stores the raw and formatted data for the Vote Plan website.

The raw data is manually downloaded from various sources, and stored in the `raw` directory.

Then a Python script converts the raw data into the standard json format.

Run `python main.py`.

To add new data or learn more about the data structure, see [DEVELOP.md](DEVELOP.md).
